\arthead{Golubev Vasily Ivanovich}{Technique of Vizualization and Interpretation of Full-Wave Seismic Modeling Results}

\begin{abstract}
The problem of vizualization and interpretation of the results of computer simulation of dynamic processes in heterogeneous geological media in the process of seismic survey of oil and gas fields was investigated.
The author proposed the technique for drawing synthetic seismograms based on results of 2D and 3D numerical full-wave modeling.
Research software ``Seismograph'' for drawing images in semi-automatical regime and saving them as graphic files was developed.
The examples of important practical geophysical results obtained with ``Seismograph'' were described.
The effective format of data representation not only at save time, but also at postprocessing stage was proposed.
Algorithms for saving data using single-process and multi-process approach were described.
\kwe Mathematical modeling, numerical grid-characteristic method, seismic survey, experimental data interpretation.
